Main idea of the project is to set what I learned during the 
Python course, using the main data analysis libraries.

It'll be my first Data Science project, on a beginner level.

To state the beginning of this small project, I should list the
libraries which will be used during the project.
They'll be:
-Numpy --> For analysing and doing complex arithmetic operations
-Pandas--> Extracting data from the array/dataset/dataframe
-Matplotlib--> Creating plots with a given pattern, such as a 
function.
-Seaborn--> Creating complex plots, to analyze further
the data, and make conclusions.

The data used was extracted from <https://www.kaggle.com/code/drfrank/basketball-players-stats-data-visualisation/data>

From the dataframe, we'll only analyze the information about the
NBA league, from the year 2010 to 2019.

Sections that will be analyzed, and why it could happen:

1. Average height and weight (start)
2. Relation between Height x Score/Height x Block/Height x Steals/Weight x Block/Turn-Overs(failures) x Score/Team x Assists/Height x Rebound
3. Correlation of variables, comparing all of them to the score of maximum and minimum score years.
